* Syncing Notebooks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: synchronization
:END:

You can sync your notebooks with a directory on your device, or
with a few different repository types: Dropbox, WebDAV, and Git.

Notebooks are written as plain text files in [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] file format.

Synchronization is currently manual -- you have to initiate it
yourself by clicking the ~Sync~ button. Button is located in the
navigation drawer.

** Repository Types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 72c5baa
:END:
*** Dropbox
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sync-repo-dropbox
:END:

The Dropbox app is not required for syncing, instead you will allow
Orgzly to contact Dropbox on your behalf using the browser.

- Go to ~Settings~
- Click on ~Sync~
- Click on ~Repositories~
- Click on ~Dropbox~ (if you already have some repositories, click the plus icon first)
- Enter the directory inside Dropbox (without "Dropbox" part)

*** WebDAV
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sync-repo-webdav
:END:

You can sync your notebooks over WebDAV with any service that supports
it, such as [[https://nextcloud.com/][Nextcloud]], for example.

- Go to ~Settings~
- Click on ~Sync~
- Click on ~Repositories~
- Click on ~WebDAV~ (if you already have some repositories, click the plus icon first)
- Enter the URL, username and password

Optionally, if the server is using a self-signed certificate for
example, you could add it here.

*** Directory (local storage)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sync-repo-directory
:END:

Notebooks can be synced with one or more directories on your device.

- Go to ~Settings~
- Click on ~Sync~
- Click on ~Repositories~
- Click on ~Directory~ (if you already have some repositories, click the plus icon first)
- Click ~Browse~ and select (or create new) directory

** Status Messages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9a103af
:END:

After syncing is done, every notebook will have its sync status
message updated.

*** No change
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 3a30eae
:END:

Notebook is already synced. Nothing to do.

*** Saved to URL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c005876
:END:

Notebook has been successfully synced by being saved to the repository
represented by URL.

*** Loaded from URL
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 77c53bc
:END:

Notebook has been successfully synced by being loaded from the
notebook represented by URL.

*** Notebook has no link and one or more remote notebooks with the same name exist
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0eb6241
:END:

Orgzly doesn't know which remote notebook to use for syncing.

Each notebook must have a link to a remote notebook. Link is
usually set automatically after the first sync. However, there are
cases when this is not possible, or when the link is removed.

Link cannot be created after the first sync if:

- Notebook was created in Orgzly, but there is already a remote
  notebook with the same name in one of the repositories
- Multiple repositories are used and there is a notebook with the same
  name in them

Link is removed when:

- Repository is renamed or deleted

Link can be set manually:

- Open the list of notebooks ("Notebooks")
- Long-click on a notebook
- Click on ~Set Link~
- Choose a repository
- Click ~Set~

Link is set if you can see the URL next to the small link icon in
notebook's details.

*** Notebook has no link and multiple repositories exist
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 4268ee7
:END:

See [[Notebook has no link and one or more remote notebooks with the same name exist]].

*** Both local and remote notebook have been modified
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: both-local-and-remote-notebook-have-been-modified
:END:

If you modify a notebook in Orgzly and at the same time (before
performing a sync) you modify its linked remote notebook, next sync
will leave the notebook in a conflicted state.

When notebook is not synced due to conflict, you have two options:

- ~Force Load~ to import remote notebook and overwrite the local version
- ~Force Save~ to export local notebook and overwrite the remote version

These actions are available in notebook's contextual menu:

- Open the list of notebooks ("Notebooks")
- Long-click on a notebook to open the menu

There is currently no other way to resolve a conflict within Orgzly itself.

**** Manually merging the two, conflicting files when using Dropbox
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cd5aaec
:END:

When the local and remote notebooks have been modified in a Dropbox
repository you can take advantage of the facts that Orgzly stores
information in text files (in the Org file format) and that Orgzly
will create a new copy of the file if you remove it from Dropbox.

For example, you might move the original, underlying .org file in
Dropbox to a different directory, then tell Orgzly to sync the files
again (which will cause Orgzly to create a new file (with the same
file name)).  You can then use an external tool (such as a diff
program) to compare your original file and the file that Orgzly
created.  You can then determine what changes were made, and which
ones you wish to keep.

Be sure to remember that the new file (the one created by Orgzly) is
where you want to put your final, merged version of the file.

** Notes for Org mode users
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-mode
:END:

Notebooks are encoded in [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] file format.

*** Generated Org files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: d25f20c
:END:

When compared to your original Org files, files generated by Orgzly
might differ in the amount of white space, outlined below. Any other
difference would be considered a serious bug.

- /By default, tags are separated from the title with a single space
  character./ You will lose your tags' indentation as if you had
  ~org-tags-column~ set to ~0~.

  - You can set ~Tags column~ in the app's preferences (under
    ~Settings / Sync / Org file format / Tags indentation~), which
    should behave just like ~org-tags-column~.

  - There is also a preference to make ~Tags column~ output compatible
    with ~org-indent-mode~.

- /Unsupported metadata below header is part of note's content./ As
  soon as any unsupported metadata is encountered, lines from that point
  until the next heading are considered part of note's content.  You
  might find an unexpected new line between supported and unsupported
  metadata, because note's content is normally separated from heading
  by a new line.

If any of this is not working for you, please [[Contact][contact]] us.

** Ignoring files in a repository
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a51773f
:END:

(Supported on Android 8 and above.)

For users who have a large number of .org files in their repository, and only want Orgzly to load some of them, a =.orgzlyignore= file can be added to the repository on a remote device. The file uses the same syntax as Git's =.gitignore= file, which lets you exclude or include files based on glob patterns. See the [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format][Git documentation]] for details on the syntax. If the repository contains a =.orgzlyignore= file, it will be consulted in the following situations:

1. When looking through the repository for .org files to load.
2. When renaming notebooks.
3. When linking a notebook to a repository (to ensure that the resulting file name does not match an ignore rule).

Please note that the =.orgzlyignore= file is not consulted each time a notebook is saved to a repository, for performance reasons.

If the ignore rules are updated such that an existing Orgzly notebook suddenly matches an ignore rule, upon the next sync occasion, Orgzly will react as if the file has been deleted from the repository. This means that the notebook's repository link is removed, and a warning message is shown, but the notebook is *not* deleted from Orgzly. However, you will not be able to link the notebook to the same repository, unless you rename it to something which does not match an ignore rule. (It would also be possible to link the notebook to a different repository, with different or no ignore rules.)

* Links
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: links
:END:

Links can be used in note's title or content. Links can be enclosed in
brackets (e.g. =[[link]]=). You can specify a name which will be displayed
instead of the link (e.g. =[[link][name]]=).

** Web page
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 6874100
:END:

=https://www.orgzlyrevived.com=

** Email
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 21a1d14
:END:

=mailto:support@orgzlyrevived.com=

** Telephone number
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 0630ac2
:END:

You can dial a phone number, compose SMS or MMS.

- =tel:1-800-555-0199=
- =voicemail:1-800-555-0199=
- =sms:1-800-555-0199=
- =sms:1-800-555-0199?body=omw%20brt=
- =smsto:1-800-555-0199=
- =mms:1-800-555-0199=
- =mmsto:1-800-555-0199=

** Location
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 93214ea
:END:

To open a map you can specify the exact location or a search query.

- =geo:40.7128,-74.0060=
- =geo:0,0?q=new+york+city=
- =geo:40.7128,-74.0060?z=11=

** File
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a7a9f79
:END:

Links to external files are supported.

Files are *relative to the main storage directory* (e.g. =/sdcard=).

- =file:Download/document.txt=
- =file:Music/song.mp3=

In Settings, you can change the relative root to point to any directory on your
device. There is one setting to set the root for absolute links (e.g. =file:/readme.txt=),
and another setting to set the root for relative links (e.g. =file:readme.txt=).

** Note
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 33542dd
:END:

Linking to notes is done using properties. Two properties are supported -- =ID= and
=CUSTOM_ID=.

If you set note's property =ID= to
=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000= you can link to the note using:

=id:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000=

Value can be anything, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier][UUID]] is recommended.

If you prefer a more user-friendly value, use =CUSTOM_ID=
property. This type of link starts with =#= character, followed by the
property value. It must be enclosed in brackets. If you set
=CUSTOM_ID= to =Meeting checklist=, linking to that note is done
using:

=[[#Meeting checklist]]=

** Notebook
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 9d5f3b9
:END:

*** Using the notebook's =ID= property
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 49c8c05
:END:

You can link to notebooks by their =ID= property.

For example, if you set the notebooks's =ID= property to
=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000=, you can link to it using:

=id:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000=

The value of the =ID= property can be anything, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier][UUID]] is recommended.

*** Using the notebook's file path
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: c5b0e4b
:END:

You can link to a notebook within the app just like you would link to an external file:

=file:gtd.org=

Only the file name matters, and it has to match the notebook you are linking to.

* Search
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search
:END:

Search expressions are separated with space.

They are implicitly joined by logical =AND=. =OR= operator is also
supported. Both operators are case insensitive. =AND= has higher
precedence than =OR=.

** Search expressions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search-expressions
:END:

Following search expressions are supported.

Some of them support ~.~ (NOT) operator (see the last column).

|-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------+---|
| Expression      | Finds notes              | Example           | . |
|-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------+---|
| =s.PERIOD=      | Scheduled within period  | ~s.today~         | N |
| =d.PERIOD=      | Deadline within period   | ~d.le.2d~         | N |
| =e.PERIOD=      | Event within period      | ~e.ge.now~        | N |
| =c.PERIOD=      | Closed within period     | ~c.yesterday~     | N |
| =cr.PERIOD=     | Created within period    | ~cr.ge.yesterday~ | N |
| =i.STATE=       | With state               | ~i.todo~          | Y |
| =it.STATE-TYPE= | With state type          | ~.it.done~        | Y |
| =b.NOTEBOOK=    | From notebook            | ~.b.Work~         | Y |
| =t.TAG=         | With tag (inherited too) | ~t.errand~        | Y |
| =tn.TAG=        | With tag (note's only)   | ~tn.toRead~       | Y |
| =p.PRIORITY=    | Having priority          | ~.p.c~            | Y |
| =ps.PRIORITY=   | Having set priority      | ~ps.b~            | Y |
|-----------------+--------------------------+-------------------+---|

=PERIOD= can be:

- =OP.TIME= -- matches time
- =none= (or =no=) -- matches notes without the property

=OP= can be:
- =eq= -- equal to =TIME=
- =ne= -- not equal to =TIME=
- =lt= -- less than =TIME=
- =le= -- less than or equal to =TIME=
- =gt= -- greater than =TIME=
- =ge= -- greater than or equal to =TIME=

If =OP= is not specified:
- Default value for =s=, =d= and =cr= is =le=
- Default value for =c= is =eq=

=TIME= can be:
- =Nh= -- =N= hours from now
- =Nd= -- =N= days from now
- =Nw= -- =N= weeks from now
- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

** Sorting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search-sorting
:END:

Default ordering of notes in the search results is by notebook name then priority. If =s=
or =d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or deadline time. They are
always sorted by position in the notebook last. 

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| =b= =book= =notebook=       | Notebook name                 |
| =t= =title=                 | Title                         |
| =s= =sched= =scheduled=     | Scheduled time                |
| =d= =dead= =deadline=       | Deadline time                 |
| =e= =event=                 | Event time                    |
| =c= =close= =closed=        | Closed time                   |
| =cr= =created=              | Created-at time               |
| =p= =pri= =prio= =priority= | Priority                      |
| =st= =state=                | States as defined in Settings |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|

When a note contains multiple events, only one of those events is
considered when sorting. With =o.event= the oldest event is used. With
=.o.event= most recent event is used.

** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search-examples
:END:

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=

** Agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: search-agenda
:END:

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day. This view is
also known as the agenda view, similar to =org-agenda= in vanilla Emacs.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

Ordering in the agenda view is different from the regular search view. In the agenda view,
notes are always sorted chronologically according to their timestamps within each
day. Timestamps that include a date but no specific time of day will be ordered later in
the day. For example, =<2025-03-30 15:00>= comes before =<2025-03-30>=. When two notes
have the same timestamps, the ordering will be determined using the same criteria
described in the *Sorting* section above.


** Search Results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: b0b0976
:END:

For each note you can tap on it to edit the note immediately.  For
each note you can also swipe right to display a menu of options that
allow you to assign a starting time, cycle through the =TODO= and
=DONE= states, or to simply mark the note as =DONE=.  If you swipe
left you'll be given a single option: displaying the note in the
notebook that contains it.

* Advanced Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: advanced-features
:END:
** Repeated Tasks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: repeated-tasks
:END:

You can easily create repeated tasks using [[the same syntax][https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html]] as in org-mode.
For example =SCHEDULED: <2025-04-30 Wed +1w>= is a valid repeated task. Once you change its status to DONE, its state will
remain the same and won't change to DONE, but its date will move one week ahead, to the next Wednesday.

* FAQ
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: faq
:END:

** How much does it cost?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cost
:END:

Orgzly Revived is free.
